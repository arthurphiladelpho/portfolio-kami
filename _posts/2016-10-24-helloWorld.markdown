# Hello World
## My First Blog Post Ever
*Not used to doing this, actually I am not one to talk a whole bunch about myself... I prefer to let my results do the talking.*

Like many life changing stories, I'd say the very beginning of my coding journey wasn’t about coding at all, I was about survival.

I was 19, in Europe for the first time, looking for adventures. After being to the Netherlands, Austria, Britain and Italy, it was my first day in Barcelona, Spain. I took my skateboard for a spin up the beach, everything was great. And then, one wrong move later, I bang my head in the concrete. Luckily, I was with some friends and they safely guided me to the hospital. It was in bed, after suffering brain trauma, that I realised something:

*It’s a dangerous world out there, and the worse can happen at any moment. If I didn’t have my parents to pay this medical bill, what would I do? I have to stay in bed for the next 6 months, how would I pay my bills? I did the math and if lucky I’d rack up one hundred thousand dollars in debt, not a good way to start my 20s.*

**I had to make money online.**
