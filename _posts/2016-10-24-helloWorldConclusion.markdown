#The Quest to Become a Developer
##When I thought it was getting simple, I got complicated
*Ok, I want to be a developer, a hacker, a software engineer but how? *

I always loved and admired the power computers have and how the right person can get behind one of those things and launch a billion dollar business.

Soon enough I discovered that a friend of mine just graduated a bootcamp and was now making over eighty thousand dollars a year.

I figured this was my path. I had had some contact with coding earlier on, but from what I here only the elite get into these top bootcamps?

The next 6 months I got deep into that JavaScript. Starting to believe that I had a chance, I learned to get around the command line and started using Sublime as my text editor. 

Finally, to top off my preparation, I did the Hack Reactor Bootcamp Prep course. This experience was awesome, I experienced another vision of online classes live and learned a bunch. I also made some pretty cool friends from all around the world.

I passed HackReactor’s technical interview but felt like I wouldn’t be a nice fit overall for their program. It was a little cold and intense for me… I opted for Bloc instead, I mentor-based learning approach with a little more time to get accustomed to all this new technology.

Currently, I’m enrolled at Bloc and freelancing based in a coworking space in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I have an experienced web developer called Miguel Archer Salgado as my mentor, with whom I meet with everyday and helps me as I get my career going.
