# Young and Foolish
## Lost in a world of confusion.
*So yeah, there I was, 5 minutes into my search and already finding all of this stuff really complicated... *

Affiliate marketing? Google AdSense? Freelancing? Doing what, why? Wait, you have to make a website, create content,so you can sell products and advertisement space on your website. Ok, fair enough, but what will I write about? What about Youtube? It’s basically the same principle right? If you generate interesting content, you can sell advertisement space and products.

Ok, all this stuff sounds great…

But if I have to do this full-time I better enjoy it. What do I enjoy? There is only one way to find out… Just do. Do everything that sounds cool. 

I started out by doing a couple of Mr. Rob Percival’s courses in Udemy. There I had my first contact with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Wordpress. He introduced me to web and app development, I was instantly hooked. I really enjoyed understanding what frontend web development was all about, but still thought that I had much to learn before picking my career.

I adventured myself learning about copyrights and how to make money on Youtube without ever filming anything. I learned that there are web design competitions in websites like 99designs and it is one way to make a living, just make amazing designs in Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. I did a 3D design course with Maya at Gnomon School, where I experienced live online classes for the first time and had a blast learning how to use 3D design software. I also did some reskinning of games, buying some source code and creating a whole new design for an existing game. This was about the time that I got back to coding, I wanted to create my own games. With this goal I learned Unity and created some basic games using the programming language C#.

By this time I was already convinced that coding was the career path I should get after.
